<p><strong>The Foundations of Social Research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What is the meaning of social research?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Social research is a systematic investigation that aims to understand and explain social phenomena, such as human behavior, social institutions, and cultural practices. It involves collecting and analyzing data to generate evidence-based knowledge that informs theory and practice.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What are the different perspectives in social research?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are various perspectives in social research, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectivist perspective:</strong> Emphasizes the external, observable aspects of social reality and uses quantitative methods to collect data.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretivist perspective:</strong> Prioritizes the subjective experiences and interpretations of individuals and uses qualitative methods to understand their perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Critical perspective:</strong> Examines social phenomena from a critical lens, focusing on power relations, inequality, and social change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3: How do different perspectives shape the research process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The chosen perspective determines various aspects of the research process, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research questions:</strong> The type of questions asked and the way they are framed are influenced by the perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Methods:</strong> The methods used to collect and analyze data are guided by the perspective's epistemological assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation of findings:</strong> The perspective frames the interpretation of research results, leading to different conclusions and implications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4: What are the strengths and limitations of different perspectives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectivist:</strong> Provides reliable and generalizable findings.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretivist:</strong> Provides in-depth understanding of individual experiences and meanings.</li>
<li><strong>Critical:</strong> Raises awareness of social inequalities and promotes change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectivist:</strong> May overlook subjective dimensions of social reality.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretivist:</strong> Can be time-consuming and may not generalize findings to larger populations.</li>
<li><strong>Critical:</strong> May be biased towards a particular social or political agenda.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5: Is it possible to combine different perspectives in social research?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, it is possible to combine different perspectives in social research to enhance the research process. For example, a mixed-methods approach can combine quantitative and qualitative methods, or a critical-interpretivist approach can blend critical theory with interpretivist methods.</p>
