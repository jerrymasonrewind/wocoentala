<p><strong>Sullivan Algebra and Trigonometry 9th Edition Solutions PDF: A Comprehensive Review</strong></p>
<p>Michael Sullivan's "Algebra and Trigonometry, 9th Edition" is a widely acclaimed textbook that provides a comprehensive introduction to both topics. To assist students in their understanding and practice, a collection of detailed solutions is available in PDF format.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Solve the equation 3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Factor the equation to get (3x + 3)(x - 3) = 0. Set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions: x = -1 and x = 3.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Find the sine of the angle 30 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Refer to the unit circle or use the trigonometric table in the textbook. The sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Simplify the expression (2x + 1)(x - 3).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use the distributive property to multiply the terms: 2x^2 - 6x + x - 3 = 2x^2 - 5x - 3.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Solve the inequality 4x - 2 &gt; 14.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Isolate the variable x by adding 2 to both sides and dividing by 4: x &gt; 4. Graph the solution on a number line.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> Find the area of a triangle with base 6 cm and height 4 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) <em> base </em> height. Substitute the values: Area = (1/2) <em> 6 </em> 4 = 12 square cm.</p>
<p>The "Sullivan Algebra and Trigonometry, 9th Edition" Solutions PDF offers invaluable support to students as they progress through the material. It clarifies concepts, provides step-by-step solutions, and reinforces understanding through practice.</p>
