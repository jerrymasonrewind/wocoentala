<p><strong>Sewage Treatment and Disposal: A Comprehensive Overview by S. K. Garg (PDF)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Sewage treatment and disposal are crucial processes in maintaining public health and environmental sustainability. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the subject matter, drawing insights from the seminal work of S. K. Garg's PDF on the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Primary sewage treatment involves basic physical processes to remove large solids and suspended particles. This is typically achieved through screening, sedimentation, and coagulation-flocculation. By removing these substances, the sewage is rendered less toxic and easier to treat further.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Secondary treatment utilizes biological processes to break down organic matter in the sewage. This is accomplished through the use of activated sludge, trickling filters, or biological towers. These microorganisms consume the organic waste, converting it into harmless byproducts.</p>
<p><strong>Tertiary Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Tertiary treatment is an optional stage that provides additional purification of the sewage. This may involve advanced filtration techniques, disinfection using chemicals or UV radiation, or the removal of specific contaminants such as nutrients or heavy metals.</p>
<p><strong>Disposal Methods</strong></p>
<p>Once treated, sewage can be disposed of in various ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land disposal:</strong> The sewage is applied to land as fertilizer or irrigation water.</li>
<li><strong>Discharge into waterways:</strong> The treated sewage is released into rivers, lakes, or oceans.</li>
<li><strong>Incineration:</strong> The sewage is burned to produce energy or reduce its volume.</li>
<li><strong>Reuse:</strong> In some cases, treated sewage is reused for non-potable purposes, such as cooling water or irrigation.</li>
</ul>
