<p><strong>Section 17.1: Atmosphere Characteristics Answer Key</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q1: Define the atmosphere and describe its importance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The atmosphere is the gaseous layer surrounding the Earth. It provides essential gases for life (oxygen and carbon dioxide), regulates temperature, and protects Earth from harmful radiation.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: List the five main layers of the atmosphere.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Starting from the ground up, the layers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Troposphere</li>
<li>Stratosphere</li>
<li>Mesosphere</li>
<li>Thermosphere</li>
<li>Exosphere</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q3: Describe the characteristics of the troposphere.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. It contains the air we breathe and is characterized by decreasing temperature with increasing altitude. Weather phenomena occur within this layer.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: Explain the role of the stratosphere in temperature regulation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The stratosphere lies above the troposphere. It contains the ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This absorption produces heat, causing the temperature in the stratosphere to increase with altitude.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: Describe the thermosphere and its significance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The thermosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere. It is characterized by extremely high temperatures and low density. The thermosphere is responsible for absorbing solar radiation and generating the aurora borealis and aurora australis.</p>
