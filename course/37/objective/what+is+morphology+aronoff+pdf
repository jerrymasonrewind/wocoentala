<p><strong>What is Morphology?</strong></p>
<p>Morphology is the study of word structure. It is a subfield of linguistics that investigates the internal structure of words, including their morphemes, roots, and affixes. Morphology is concerned with how words are formed, how they are related to other words, and how they change their form to express different meanings.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Morpheme?</strong></p>
<p>A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language. It cannot be divided into smaller meaningful units. Morphemes can be either free morphemes or bound morphemes. Free morphemes can stand alone as words, while bound morphemes must be attached to other morphemes. For example, the word "dog" is a free morpheme, while the suffix "-s" is a bound morpheme.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Root?</strong></p>
<p>A root is the core of a word. It is the part of the word that carries the basic meaning. Roots can be either simple or complex. Simple roots consist of a single syllable, while complex roots consist of two or more syllables. For example, the word "dog" is a simple root, while the word "computer" is a complex root.</p>
<p><strong>What is an Affix?</strong></p>
<p>An affix is a morpheme that is attached to a root. Affixes can either be prefixes or suffixes. Prefixes are attached to the beginning of a root, while suffixes are attached to the end of a root. For example, the prefix "un-" means "not," while the suffix "-ly" means "in a manner."</p>
<p><strong>How Do Morphemes Combine to Form Words?</strong></p>
<p>Morphemes combine to form words in a variety of ways. The most common way is through agglutination. Agglutination is the process of adding affixes to a root. For example, the word "dogs" is formed by adding the suffix "-s" to the root "dog." Another way that morphemes can combine to form words is through compounding. Compounding is the process of combining two or more words to form a new word. For example, the word "blackboard" is formed by combining the words "black" and "board."</p>
