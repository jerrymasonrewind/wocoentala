<p><b>What is the hardest field of math?</b> Pure math (analysis, abstract algebra, graph theory, topology, etc.) is probably on average the hardest, but there is going to be some variability. In layman's terms pure math is proving math.</p>
<p><b>What is the next class after linear algebra?</b> If you have completed Linear Algebra (Math 220), then you have several options. Multivariable Calculus (Math 226) and Differential Equations I (Math 232) are good options for science and economics majors.</p>
<p><b>Is linear algebra a college level?</b> Due to its broad range of applications, linear algebra is one of the most widely taught subjects in college-level mathematics (and increasingly in high school).</p>
<p><b>Did Einstein use linear algebra?</b> Additionally, much of his work required the use of differential equations, linear algebra, in addition to discrete math / propositional logic and matrices.</p>
<p><b>What is linear algebra in real life?</b> Linear algebra plays an important role to determine unknown quantities. The real-life applications of linear algebra are: For calculation of speed, distance, or time. Used for projecting a three-dimensional view into a two-dimensional plane, handled by linear maps.</p>
