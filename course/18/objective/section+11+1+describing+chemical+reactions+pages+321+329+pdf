<p><strong>1. What is a chemical reaction?</strong></p>
<p>A chemical reaction is a process in which a set of reactants undergo changes to form a set of products. These changes involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds between atoms.</p>
<p><strong>2. What are the different types of chemical reactions?</strong></p>
<p>There are many different types of chemical reactions, each characterized by its own set of reactants and products. Some common types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combination reactions:</strong> Two or more reactants combine to form a single product.</li>
<li><strong>Decomposition reactions:</strong> A single reactant breaks down into two or more products.</li>
<li><strong>Single-replacement reactions:</strong> One element replaces another element in a compound.</li>
<li><strong>Double-replacement reactions:</strong> Two compounds exchange ions to form two new compounds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. What are the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction?</strong></p>
<p>The rate of a chemical reaction is influenced by several factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> The higher the concentration of reactants, the faster the reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Surface area:</strong> The greater the surface area of the reactants, the faster the reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Catalysis:</strong> The presence of a catalyst can increase the reaction rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. What is equilibrium?</strong></p>
<p>Equilibrium is a state in which the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time. In an equilibrium reaction, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate.</p>
<p><strong>5. How is equilibrium affected by changes in conditions?</strong></p>
<p>Changes in conditions, such as temperature, concentration, or pressure, can shift the equilibrium of a reaction. For example, increasing the temperature typically favors the endothermic reaction, while increasing the pressure favors the reaction that results in a smaller number of moles of gas.</p>
