<p><strong>Q1: What is the purpose of a circuit?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> A circuit provides a path for electrical current to flow, allowing the transfer of energy or information.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: Explain the concept of voltage and current in relation to circuits.</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Voltage represents the electrical potential difference between two points in a circuit, while current is the rate at which electrical charge flows through a circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: How do resistors affect circuits?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Resistors limit the flow of current, creating a voltage drop across them. They are used to control the amount of current flowing through a circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: What is the difference between a series and parallel circuit?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> In a series circuit, components are connected in a single loop with each device's current being the same. In a parallel circuit, components have multiple paths for current to flow, resulting in different currents through each device.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: How can you analyze circuits using Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Ohm's Law relates voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit. Kirchhoff's Laws help analyze circuits by providing relationships between voltages and currents at junctions and loops within the circuit.</p>
