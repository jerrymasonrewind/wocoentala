<p><strong>World History Chapter 11 Section 2: Imperialism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What were the primary factors that motivated European imperialism?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Economic gain, nationalism, and social Darwinism drove European imperialism. Industrialization and the need for raw materials and new markets fueled economic ambitions. Nationalism promoted a sense of superiority and territorial expansion. Social Darwinism justified imperialism as a natural process of survival of the fittest.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> How did European powers justify their colonization of non-Western societies?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Europeans employed various justifications, including the racist ideology of Social Darwinism, the "civilizing mission" to bring modernity and Christianity to "backward" societies, and the legal concept of "effective occupation" to claim territories.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> What were the methods used by European powers to establish and maintain control over their colonies?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Europeans established colonial regimes through conquest, treaties, and diplomatic pressure. They imposed their political, economic, and social systems on colonized territories. Military force, administrative systems, and economic exploitation were key methods of control.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What were the consequences of imperialism for indigenous peoples?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Imperialism had devastating consequences for indigenous peoples. Their lands were seized, their cultures suppressed, and their economies disrupted. They were subjected to forced labor, disease, and exploitation. Imperialism also led to the loss of traditional ways of life and the emergence of new social and political hierarchies.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> How did imperialism shape the global order?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Imperialism reshaped the global map, creating European empires that spanned vast territories. It led to increased global trade, the movement of people and ideas, and the spread of Western values and technology. Imperialism also contributed to tensions and conflicts both within and between European powers, ultimately contributing to the outbreak of World War I.</p>
