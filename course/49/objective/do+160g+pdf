<p><b>What is the RTCA DO-160G Section 18?</b> RTCA/DO-160 Section 18 provides test procedures to determine if the EUT will operate as specified when audio frequency interference is applied to the AC and/or DC power input. RTCA/DO-160 Section 18 is similar MIL-STD 461F test method CS101 with the only difference being test level and frequency range.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 mil STD 810 comparison?</b> What are the main differences between DO-160 & MIL-STD-810? By schematizing, we could say that DO160 is designed to test aeronautical equipment while MIL STD 810 is used to test ground equipment. Some of the tests are similar, but each standard also has specific tests dedicated to their field of application.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 environmental qualifications?</b> DO-160, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, published by RTCA (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics), is the international standard that defines environmental test conditions and applicable test procedures and criteria for avionic equipment to determine their performance ...</p>
<p><b>DO-160 vibration categories?</b> There are three tests, each with one or more categories, associated with DO-160 vibration testing: Standard Vibration Test (Category S), Robust Vibration Test (Categories R, U, U2) and High-Level, Short-Duration Vibration Test (Categories H, Z).</p>
<p><b>DO-160 overpressure tests?</b> The overpressure testing simulates ordinary aircraft pressurization. The temperature testing includes operating low and high temperatures, ground survival temperatures and the simulation of short-time operating temperatures and the loss of in-flight cooling.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 sand and dust test?</b> The RTCA DO-160 sand and dust test standard determines the resistance of the equipment to the effects of blowing sand and dust. The test involves the sand and dust being carried by air movement at moderate speeds.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 power supply?</b> The AGPS DO-160 aviation power supply series is conduction cooled via baseplate and can reliable operate at full rated power with a baseplate temperature from -40°C to +85°C. The baseplate is also used to mount the power supply.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 fluid susceptibility?</b> The RTCA DO-160 fluids susceptibility test standard determines whether equipment can withstand the effects of fluid contaminants. The DO-160G fluids susceptibility test should only be conducted in certain situations.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 lightning tests?</b> The RTCA DO-160 Section 23 determines the ability of equipment to survive the direct effects of a lightning strike. This test standard applies to externally mounted equipment.</p>
<p><b>DO-160G section 4?</b> RTCA DO-160 Section 4.0 testing is performed to ensure the proper functionality of equipment at the different temperatures and altitudes this equipment will be exposed to in standard operating environments.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 crash safety?</b> The purpose of the RTCA DO-160 operational shock and crash safety test is to determine the ability of equipment to continue to operate during normal aircraft operations.</p>
<p><b>Do 160g section 5?</b> RTCA DO-160 Section 5.0 testing verifies the performance characteristics of equipment when exposed to the extreme temperature variations that occur in its standard operating environment.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 humidity tests?</b> The purpose of RTCA DO-160 humidity testing is to determine the ability of equipment to withstand humid atmospheres. These atmospheric conditions could be either natural or induced. Humidity testing labs test to this standard to determine corrosion and other equipment changes.</p>
<p><b>What is the RTCA DO-160G Section 15?</b> The RTCA/DO-160 Section 15 measures the magnetic effect of the equipment and its main goal is to determine the closest distance to compasses or compass sensors (flux gates) at which that unit is allowed to be installed.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 salt fog?</b> The RTCA DO-160 salt fog test standard determines the effects of ocean conditions. These conditions are a salt atmosphere that can be extremely corrosive. Products placed in service on a plane operated near or over a salt water body of water are susceptible.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 power input tests?</b> The RTCA DO-160 power inputs test defines the test conditions and procedures for AC and DC electrical power applied to the terminals of equipment to be tested. RTCA-DO-160 power testing covers the following electrical power supplies: 14 V dc, 28 V dc and 270 V dc.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 latest version?</b> The current version is DO-160G, published in 2010 and is referenced for use by FAA's Advisory Circular AC 21-16G as well as other regulatory authorities around the world.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 certification requirements?</b> Included in DO-160 various test methods and requirements are minimum performance standards for Environmental evaluations (climatic and dynamic conditions), power input variations and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) / Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) conditions.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 temperature ranges?</b> The test chamber should also have the system that circulates the air during the test to maintain this temperature uniformity. According to clause 3.5, the tests should be performed within: Ambient temperature of +15 to +35 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between MIL-STD-461 and RTCA DO-160?</b> MIL-STD-461 identifies a Data Item Description (DID) DI- EMCS-80201C that provides an outline and describes the content to be provided in the EMI Test Procedure (EMITP). RTCA-DO-160 serves as a procedure document.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 temperature ranges?</b> The test chamber should also have the system that circulates the air during the test to maintain this temperature uniformity. According to clause 3.5, the tests should be performed within: Ambient temperature of +15 to +35 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 induced signal susceptibility?</b> RTCA/DO-160 Section 19 provides test procedures to determine whether the EUT can operate as required when the equipment and interconnecting cables are subjected to audio frequency electric fields, magnetic fields, and transient voltage spikes.</p>
<p><b>DO-160 fluid susceptibility?</b> The RTCA DO-160 fluids susceptibility test standard determines whether equipment can withstand the effects of fluid contaminants. The DO-160G fluids susceptibility test should only be conducted in certain situations.</p>
