<p><b>What is computer graphics pdf?</b> Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures on computer screens with the help of programming. It involves computations, creation, and manipulation of data.</p>
<p><b>What is OpenGL in computer graphics?</b> OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, multi-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.</p>
<p><b>Is OpenGL an AC library?</b> The OpenGL libraries are written in C and allows for many derivations in other languages, but in its core it remains a C-library.</p>
<p><b>How to install OpenGL in computer graphics?</b> </p>
<p><b>What is the full form of PDF in computer graphics?</b> PDF is an abbreviation that stands for Portable Document Format. It's a versatile file format created by Adobe that gives people an easy, reliable way to present and exchange documents - regardless of the software, hardware, or operating systems being used by anyone who views the document.</p>
<p><b>What is computer graphics in C++?</b> Graphics in C++ is defined to create a graphic model like creating different shapes and adding colors to it. It can be done in the C++ console by importing graphics. h library to GCC compiler. We can draw the circle, line, eclipse, and other geometric shapes too.</p>
<p><b>Is OpenGL for C or C++?</b> Since OpenGL is a graphics API and not a platform of its own, it requires a language to operate in and the language of choice is C++ .</p>
<p><b>Is OpenGL a CPU or GPU?</b> The architecture of OpenGL is based on a client-server model. An application program written to use the OpenGL API is the "client" and runs on the CPU. The implementation of the OpenGL graphics engine (including the GLSL shader programs you will write) is the "server" and runs on the GPU.</p>
<p><b>Is OpenGL hardware or software?</b> The OpenGL specification describes an abstract application programming interface (API) for drawing 2D and 3D graphics. It is designed to be implemented mostly or entirely using hardware acceleration such as a GPU, although it is possible for the API to be implemented entirely in software running on a CPU.</p>
<p><b>What is a computer graphics?</b> Computer graphics is a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Although the term often refers to the study of three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing.</p>
<p><b>What is the definition of graphics?</b> Graphics refers to visual images or designs created or displayed on a screen or printed on a physical medium. Graphics are used to communicate information, convey ideas, or enhance the visual appeal of various forms of media.</p>
<p><b>What is computer graphic design?</b> Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users' specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs to optimize the user experience.</p>
<p><b>What is the definition of graphic design in PDF?</b> Graphic design, also known as communication design, is the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content. The form it takes can be physical or virtual and can include images, words, or graphics.</p>
