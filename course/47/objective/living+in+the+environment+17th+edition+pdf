<p><b>How can we control imbalances in the environment?</b> </p>
<p><b>When was living in the environment published?</b> </p>
<p><b>What are the 5 ways to help solve environmental problems?</b> </p>
<p><b>What is the main cause of environmental imbalance?</b> Deforestation, global warming and waste accumulation are the most important factors responsible for environmental imbalance. Plants and trees play an important role in regulating the climate. They release oxygen into the air and absorb carbon dioxide from the air.</p>
<p><b>Which was the first book that urged society to become more environmentally aware?</b> Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, published in 1962, was a landmark in the development of the modern environmental movement.</p>
<p><b>When did people become environmentally conscious?</b> The contemporary environmental movement arose primarily from concerns in the late 19th century about the protection of the countryside in Europe and the wilderness in the United States and the health consequences of pollution during the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p><b>Who is the author of the book entitled Living in the Environment?</b> "Inspiring people to care about the planet." In the new edition of LIVING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, authors Tyler Miller and Scott Spoolman have partnered with the National Geographic Society to develop a text designed to equip students with the inspiration and knowledge they need to make a difference solving today's ...</p>
<p><b>What are the four human activities that destroy the environment?</b> Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation.</p>
<p><b>What is the most serious problem facing the environment today?</b> Global warming is responsible for changes in weather patterns such as warmer summers, shorter winters, and extreme weather. Fossil fuels used for electricity and tra nsportation, deforestation, landfills, and fertilizers contribute to climate change.</p>
<p><b>What causes the most damage to the environment?</b> Fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas – are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions. As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat.</p>
<p><b>Who is the root cause of environmental problems?</b> Deforestation, overgrazing, pollution, and climate change all contribute to environmental degradation and can lead to decreased crop yields and water shortages. These factors can all contribute to poverty, as people are unable to produce enough food to feed their families.</p>
<p><b>What is the biggest cause of environmental problems?</b> Since the Industrial Revolution, the burning of fossil fuels and other activities have increased the number of greenhouse gas emissions in Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in global warming. The resulting climate change has accelerated disruption of the environment and vital natural processes.</p>
<p><b>What are the 5 human impacts on the environment?</b> The five major impacts humans have on the environment include deforestation, global warming, overharvesting, pollution, and agriculture. These have contributed to vast species extinctions, incremental and continuous rises in the sea level, and record setting hot temperatures in the earth's greenhouse atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>How can we prevent imbalance in nature?</b> Recycle to help prevent the over-harvesting of natural resources. Conserve energy by choosing more energy efficient appliances and automobiles. If everybody uses less energy, pollution decreases and less coal gets used to power the nation and the world.</p>
