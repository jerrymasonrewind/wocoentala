<p><b>Is it worth buying the player handbook on D&D Beyond?</b> The books are separate purchases- without it you only have access to the basic content (still enough to get you started if you want to try it out). I've been using it for over a year- and I really like it.</p>

<p><b>Can you play DnD without the handbook?</b> Sure. If you know the mechanics and have the character sheets, you *can* play without the books. If you are starting from square one, the PHB is the minimum you will need to be able to play. Everything else â€” the DM Guide, the Monster Manual, the campaign books, the player rules expansions, etc.</p>
<p><b>Can I download my D&D beyond books?</b> You cannot download anything from the site or app as a PDF, besides your character sheets. Purchases only grant access via the website or app.</p>

<p><b>Should I buy books on D&D Beyond?</b> One thing about a game like D&D is that you really only need one person in a group that has the books- things get tougher if you're trying to use the DDB character generator, but if money's an issue (or even if it isn't) you definitely shouldn't feel obligated to purchase anything.</p>
<p><b>Should a DM get the players handbook?</b> As a DM (and as a player), you'll definitely want the Player's Handbook. It has most of the rules you'll want, all the classes and many subclasses plus the most common races. As a player, you can stop there for now.</p>
<p><b>Is the DnD player bundle worth it?</b> Those are great books, and they are worth purchasing. I run for a number of people that cannot afford much so I have purchased all Classes, subclasses, feats, and back grounds for my groups to share.</p>
<p><b>Is the D&D Beyond bundle worth it?</b> Ultimately, D&D Beyond's Legendary Bundle is a fantastic investment for DMs or D&D groups who want to make the purchase together. While it is expensive, the amount of content and money off future digital books does make it worth it.</p>
