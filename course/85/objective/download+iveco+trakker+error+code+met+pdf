<p><b>How to clear fault code?</b> How do you clear codes using an OBD II scanner? Plug the scanner into the car's OBD II port, cycle the ignition to the ON position, select the "Erase Codes" option on the scanner's menu, and confirm the clearing of stored error codes.</p>
<p><b>Where is the sensor code?</b> Each sensor has its own code printed on the back of the adhesive patch.</p>
<p><b>What is the EML warning light?</b> An engine management light, or EML (sometimes also called the 'check engine light') is a dashboard warning light that illuminates when an issue with your car's engine, exhaust or emissions system has cropped up.</p>
<p><b>What is the emissions fault warning?</b> Causes of the “Check Emission System” Warning Light Some of the potential causes include: Faulty oxygen sensor. Malfunctioning catalytic converter. Loose or damaged gas cap.</p>
<p><b>What does the engine fault indicator mean?</b> When your car's internal computer identifies a problem with the engine or transmission, it turns on the check engine light. The reasons for a check engine light turning on can range from something minor like a loose gas cap to something more serious like a faulty catalytic converter.</p>
