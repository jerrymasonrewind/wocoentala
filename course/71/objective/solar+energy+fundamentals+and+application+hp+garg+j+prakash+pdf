<p><strong>Solar Energy Fundamentals and Applications: Key Questions and Answers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is solar energy and how is it harnessed?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Solar energy originates from the sun's radiation. It can be converted into usable forms of energy through photovoltaic (PV) cells and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. PV cells directly convert sunlight into electricity, while CSP systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight to generate heat for electricity production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Solar energy is clean, renewable, and has low operating costs. However, it depends on sunlight availability, which can vary by location and time of day. Installation costs can also be higher compared to traditional energy sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: How can solar energy be used for residential and commercial purposes?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Rooftop solar PV systems can generate electricity for homes and businesses, reducing their reliance on the grid. Solar-powered water heaters can also provide hot water without consuming fossil fuels. In commercial applications, solar energy can be used for lighting, air conditioning, and power generation in remote locations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: What are the latest advancements in solar technology?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Recent advancements include the development of high-efficiency solar cells, integrated storage systems, and grid-tied micro-inverters. These technologies enhance the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of solar energy systems.</p>
