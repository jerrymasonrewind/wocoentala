<p><b>What is the ASTM D2699 method?</b> ASTM D2699 (RON) test method is used to test the knock rating of spark-ignition engine fuel in Research Octane Number. The sample fuel is tested using a standardized RON test engine with a single cylinder, four-stroke cycle, variable compression ratio, carburetor.</p>
<p><b>What is the full form of SI engine?</b> 1 Spark-Ignition Engine. The spark-ignition engine (Fig. 20A) is the universal engine for all fuels of low inflammability, especially gasoline (a mixture of several hydrocarbons), but also liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), methanol and ethanol (alcohols), and hydrogen.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between spark and compression ignition?</b> Spark ignition engines use a spark (across a spark plug) to ignite a compressed fuel-air mixture. Typical fuels for such engines are gasoline and natural gas. Compression ignition engines compress air to a high pressure, heating the air to the ignition temperature of the fuel, which then is injected.</p>
<p><b>What are the differences in pistons between SI and CI?</b> Working principle of Piston engines They only differ in the way of filling the fresh charge and removing burnt gases from the cylinder. The compression ratio of the SI engine is between 6 to 10 whereas, for CI, it is from 16 to 20.</p>
<p><b>What is the octane method?</b> The octane number is actually the simple average of two different octane rating methods—motor octane rating (MOR) and research octane rating (RON)—that differ primarily in the specifics of the operating conditions. The higher an octane number, the more stable the fuel.</p>
<p><b>What is the research octane number test?</b> Two octane tests can be performed for gasoline. The motor octane number (MON) indicates engine performance at highway conditions with high speeds (900 rpm). On the other hand, the research octane number is indicative of low-speed city driving (600 rpm).</p>
<p><b>Is IC engine and SI engine the same?</b> IC engine is any engine which converts chemical energy of the fuel(mostly petrol or diesel) into useful mechanical energy where as SI engine (Petrol engine) is a type of IC engine which uses petrol as it's fuel and a spark plug to ignite to fuel in order to complete the Combustion process and produce work.</p>
<p><b>Is diesel engine a SI engine?</b> Compression Ignition (CI) Engine: It is also known as the Diesel engine. Spark Ignition (SI) Engine: It is also known as the Petrol engine.</p>
<p><b>Why is SI engine more efficient?</b> SI engine of equal displacement running at the same speed. both full load and part load. The excess air supplied to the CI engine and its higher compression ratio help to increase the indicated thermal efficiency. improves at part load because fuel injection is ended sooner.</p>
<p><b>Why is compression ignition more efficient?</b> The CI diesel thermodynamic cycle efficiency advantage over the more common SI gasoline engine stems from three major factors: the CI's use of lean mixtures, its lack of throttling of the intake charge, and its higher compression ratios.</p>
<p><b>Why is it called a compression ignition engine?</b> The diesel engine, named after Rudolf Diesel, is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder due to mechanical compression; thus, the diesel engine is called a compression-ignition engine (CI engine).</p>
<p><b>Why do gas engines not use compression ignition?</b> If the same high compression ratios were to be applied to a gasoline engine, the fuel air mixture would ignite too early in its compression. This would force the engine to change its direction nearly instantaneously. The compression ratio of the gasoline engine is typically much lower than that of a diesel engine.</p>
<p><b>What is the compression ratio of a diesel engine?</b> The heat of the compressed air ignites the fuel spontaneously. A diesel engine does not contain a spark plug. A gasoline engine compresses at a ratio of 8:1 to 12:1, while a diesel engine compresses at a ratio of 14:1 to as high as 25:1. The higher compression ratio of the diesel engine leads to better efficiency.</p>
<p><b>What is the function of the piston in the SI engine?</b> The piston is a moving part of the combustion chamber. It is responsible for converting the energy released during the combustion process into mechanical work. The piston also performs a number of other important tasks: It seals the combustion chamber.</p>
<p><b>What are the two basic types of piston engines?</b> The two principal types of internal-combustion piston engines are spark-ignition engines and compression-ignition (diesel) engines.</p>
<p><b>What is the ASTM D6730 method?</b> The ASTM D6730 describes a standard test method for individual components in spark ignition engine fuels by high resolution gas chromatography. The D6730 in comparison to the ASTM 6729 uses a pre column for pre-selection of the components.</p>
<p><b>What is the standard test method for motor octane number of spark-ignition engine fuel?</b> ASTM D2700 (MON) laboratory test method is used to rating the spark-ignition engine fuel in Motor Octane Number. The sample fuel is tested using a standardized MON test engine with a single cylinder, four-stroke cycle, variable compression ratio, carburetor.</p>
<p><b>What is the ASTM method D5453?</b> ASTM D5453 is one of the most used standard test method for the determination of total sulfur content in liquid hydrocarbon matrixes boiling in the range of 25 to 400 °C. Viscosities for this method lay between 0.2 and 20 cst(mm2/S).</p>
<p><b>What is ASTM method d3173?</b> Moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon percents constitute the proximate analysis of coal and coke. 1.1 This test method covers the determination of moisture in the analysis sample of coal or coke. It is used for calculating other analytical results to a dry basis.</p>
