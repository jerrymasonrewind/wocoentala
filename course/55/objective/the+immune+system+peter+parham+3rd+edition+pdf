<p><strong>The Immune System by Peter Parham: Questions and Answers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the purpose of the immune system?</strong>
A: The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that protects the body from infection and disease. It recognizes and attacks foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, while distinguishing them from the body's own cells.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the three main types of immunity?</strong>
A: The three main types of immunity are innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and passive immunity. Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense, providing immediate protection against pathogens. Adaptive immunity is acquired over time and provides long-lasting and specific protection against particular pathogens. Passive immunity is temporary protection acquired through the transfer of antibodies from another source, such as from a mother to her newborn baby.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What cells are involved in the immune response?</strong>
A: The immune response involves a wide range of cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes (such as T cells and B cells), and natural killer cells. Each type of cell has a specific role in recognizing, destroying, or regulating the immune response.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does the immune system adapt to new threats?</strong>
A: The adaptive immune system has the ability to adapt to new threats through a process called somatic hypermutation. This process results in the generation of new antibodies that are specifically tailored to recognize and neutralize specific pathogens.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are some common disorders of the immune system?</strong>
A: Common disorders of the immune system include allergies, autoimmune diseases (such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis), and immunodeficiencies (such as HIV/AIDS and severe combined immunodeficiency). These disorders can lead to a variety of symptoms and can impact the body's ability to fight infection and maintain homeostasis.</p>
