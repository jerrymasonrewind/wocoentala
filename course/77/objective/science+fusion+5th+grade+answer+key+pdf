<p><strong>Science Fusion 5th Grade Answer Key PDF: Practice Questions and Solutions</strong></p>
<p>The Science Fusion program for 5th grade provides a comprehensive curriculum that engages students in scientific concepts through hands-on activities, investigations, and critical thinking. To support students' learning, the answer key is an essential resource that offers detailed solutions to the questions posed in the student textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>
<p>What is the difference between a hypothesis and a theory?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for an observation or a phenomenon, while a theory is a widely accepted explanation that has been supported by multiple experiments and observations. A hypothesis is often the first step in developing a theory.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>
<p>Describe the three states of matter.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. In a solid, the particles are tightly packed together and have a fixed shape and volume. In a liquid, the particles are closely spaced but can move past one another, giving liquids a definite volume but no definite shape. In a gas, the particles are far apart and move freely, filling the container they are in.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>
<p>Explain how plants use sunlight to make food.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Plants have a green pigment called chlorophyll that absorbs sunlight. This energy is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The hydrogen from the water molecules is then used to combine with carbon dioxide from the air to form glucose, a sugar that plants use for energy.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong></p>
<p>Describe the parts of a flower and their functions.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The main parts of a flower are the petals, sepals, pistil, and stamen. Petals attract pollinators, while sepals protect the bud. The pistil contains the ovary and the stigma, where pollen lands. The stamen contains the anther, which produces pollen.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong></p>
<p>Explain how animals adapt to their environments.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Animals adapt to their environments through physical and behavioral adaptations. Physical adaptations include changes in body structures or functions, such as camouflage or sharp teeth for hunting. Behavioral adaptations include changes in behavior, such as migrating or hibernating, to increase chances of survival in a particular environment.</p>
