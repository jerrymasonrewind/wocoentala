<p><b>What is the need of computer organization and architecture?</b> Understanding computer organization and architecture is crucial for designing efficient computer systems, improving existing ones, and making informed decisions about hardware resources. It also helps in optimizing software to make full use of the underlying hardware and enhance overall system performance.</p>
<p><b>What are the four types of computer architecture?</b> Computer architecture can be broadly classified into several major categories, including Von Neumann Architecture, Harvard Architecture, Modified Harvard Architecture, and RISC & CISC Architectures. Let's delve into the details of each type and understand their unique features.</p>
<p><b>What is computer organization in computer architecture?</b> Computer Organization is realization of what is specified by the computer architecture . It deals with how operational attributes are linked together to meet the requirements specified by computer architecture. Some organizational attributes are hardware details, control signals, peripherals.</p>
<p><b>What are the features of computer architecture and computer Organisation?</b> Computer Architecture comprises logical functions such as instruction sets, registers, data types, and addressing modes. Computer Organization consists of physical units like circuit designs, peripherals, and adders.</p>
<p><b>What is the most important part of the computer architecture?</b> The processor — hardware that executes computer programs — is the primary part of any computer. Booting up: At the most elementary level of a computer design, programs are executed by the processor whenever the computer is switched on.</p>
<p><b>What is the objective of computer architecture and organization?</b> 1 To know the background of internal communication of computer 2 To have better idea on how to write assemble language programs 3 To be clear with memory management techniques 4 To better with IO devices communication with processor 5 To notice how to perform computer arithmetic operations 6 To be clear with pipeline ...</p>
<p><b>What are the 5 basic units of computer architecture?</b> </p>
<p><b>What are the 7 components of a computer?</b> </p>
<p><b>What are the 4 layers of computer architecture?</b> The layers of computer architecture are the hardware, operating system, software, and user layers.</p>
<p><b>What is the basic structure of computers in computer organization and architecture?</b> The main components of the basic structure of computers are the control processing unit (CPU), an input unit, memory unit, control unit, and output unit.</p>
<p><b>What are the basic concepts of computer organization?</b> Answer: The basic organization of a computer system is the processing unit, memory unit, and input-output devices. The processing unit controls all the functions of the computer system. It is the brain of the computer e.g. CPU.</p>
<p><b>What is computer architecture pdf?</b> Computer architecture is concerned with the structure and behav- ior of the various functional modules of the computer and how they interact to provide the processing needs of the user. Computer organization is con- cerned with the way the hardware components are connected together to form a computer system.</p>
<p><b>Why do we study computer organization and architecture?</b> The subject explores how machines are designed, built, and operate. Knowing what's inside and how it works will help you design, develop, and implement applications better, faster, cheaper, more efficient, and easier to use because you will be able to make informed decisions instead of guestimating and assuming.</p>
<p><b>What are two differences between computer organization & computer architecture?</b> Computer Architecture explains what a computer does and focuses on the functional behaviour of computer systems. On the other hand, Computer Organisation explains how a computer does it and focuses on the structural relationship and deep knowledge of the internal working of a system.</p>
<p><b>What are the main components of computer architecture?</b> </p>
<p><b>Why is organization important in architecture?</b> Architects fail when they don't have the right relationship to the organization. – In a mature architect organization the team works together towards a common set of outcomes. Reporting lines become less important than architect community cohesion and value delivery.</p>
<p><b>What are the importance of computers in an organization?</b> People use computer to automate the process of distribution, marketing, and manufacturing in businesses. A computer helps speed up the business operations and produce advanced, quality output. It also enables businesses to communicate and transact with their customers more conveniently and easily.</p>
<p><b>Why do we need to study computer network architecture?</b> Your network architecture governs how your business accesses, uses and benefits from the internet. With a proper network design, your business not only remains connected, but also continues to enjoy reliable internet speeds.</p>
<p><b>What do you learn in computer organization and architecture?</b> Computer architecture courses will cover computer performance, data paths and computer organization. In addition, you may gain an in-depth understanding of digital logic by constructing and programming your own computer in class.</p>
