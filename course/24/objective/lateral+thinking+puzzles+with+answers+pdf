<p><b>What is the random entry technique in lateral thinking?</b> The random input technique is a lateral thinking tool that involves picking a random word (usually a noun) or an image and following its associations until you find new ideas that can be applied to your problem. For random inputs to work, you'll need a well-defined problem or, a “focus”.</p>
<p><b>What are the tools for lateral thinking?</b> Edward de Bono proposed four techniques for lateral thinking: awareness, random stimulation, alternatives, and alteration.

<p><b>Can lateral thinking be taught?</b> Schools have traditionally focused on critical thinking, only. That vision that was served by this policy is slipping away, and schools need to adapt. Thinking- and lateral thinking in particular- can be taught by any teacher to any student using specific techniques.</p>
