<p><b>What are the 5 basic chemistry?</b> The five primary branches of chemistry are physical chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry.</p>
<p><b>What is the most important rule in chemistry?</b> The law of conservation of mass is often referred to as the most fundamental concept of chemistry. This was put forward by Antoine Lavoisier. The law of conservation of mass states that: In the process of a chemical reaction, the amount of matter involved remains the same before and after the reaction occurs.</p>
