<p><strong>Question:</strong> Solve problem 2.12 from the textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Problem 2.12:
A closed system undergoes a cycle consisting of the following processes:
1-2: Isobaric expansion at 100 kPa from V1 = 0.1 m^3 to V2 = 0.2 m^3
2-3: Isochoric cooling to P3 = 50 kPa
3-1: Isothermal compression to the initial state

Determine the net work done and the net heat transfer during the cycle.

Solution:
Using the first law of thermodynamics:

Q - W = ΔU

For the process 1-2:
W1-2 = P(V2 - V1) = 100 kPa (0.2 m^3 - 0.1 m^3) = 10 kJ

For the process 2-3:
Q2-3 = ΔU = 0 (isochoric process)
W2-3 = 0

For the process 3-1:
W3-1 = RT ln(V1/V3) = 8.314 kJ/mol K * 298 K * ln(0.1 m^3/0.2 m^3) = -5.08 kJ
Q3-1 = 0 (isothermal process)

Therefore, the net work done is:

W_net = W1-2 + W2-3 + W3-1 = 10 kJ + 0 - 5.08 kJ = 4.92 kJ

And the net heat transfer is:

Q_net = Q1-2 + Q2-3 + Q3-1 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 kJ</code></pre>
