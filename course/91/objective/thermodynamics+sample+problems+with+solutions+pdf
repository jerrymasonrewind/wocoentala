<p><strong>Thermodynamics Sample Problems with Solutions PDF: A Comprehensive Guide</strong></p>
<p>Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with the relationships between temperature, pressure, volume, and energy. It is a fundamental subject in engineering and many other fields. Thermodynamics sample problems with solutions can help you to understand the concepts of thermodynamics and to apply them to real-world problems.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> A gas is compressed from an initial volume of 10 L to a final volume of 5 L. The initial pressure is 2 atm. What is the final pressure?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The ideal gas law states that PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. Since the number of moles of gas and the temperature are constant, we can write:</p>
<p>P1V1 = P2V2
2 atm <em> 10 L = P2 </em> 5 L
P2 = 4 atm</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> A heat engine operates between a hot reservoir at 1000 K and a cold reservoir at 300 K. What is the maximum possible efficiency of this engine?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The maximum possible efficiency of a heat engine is given by the Carnot efficiency:</p>
<p>η = 1 - Tc/Th
η = 1 - 300 K / 1000 K
η = 0.7</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> A 1 kg block of ice at -10°C is placed in a room at 20°C. How much heat is required to melt the ice and raise its temperature to 20°C?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The heat required to melt the ice is given by:</p>
<p>Q = mLf
Q = (1 kg) * (334 kJ/kg)
Q = 334 kJ</p>
<p>The heat required to raise the temperature of the water from 0°C to 20°C is given by:</p>
<p>Q = mcΔt
Q = (1 kg) <em> (4.18 kJ/kg°C) </em> (20°C)
Q = 83.6 kJ</p>
<p>Therefore, the total heat required is:</p>
<p>Q = 334 kJ + 83.6 kJ = 417.6 kJ</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> A piston-cylinder assembly contains 1 kg of air at 20°C and 1 atm. The piston is moved slowly so that the air is compressed to 1/3 of its original volume. What is the final temperature of the air?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For an adiabatic process (no heat transfer), the ideal gas law can be written as:</p>
<p>PVγ = constant
where γ is the ratio of specific heats (cp/cv). For air, γ = 1.4. Therefore, we can write:</p>
<p>P1V1^γ = P2V2^γ
1 atm <em> (1 L)^1.4 = P2 </em> (1/3 L)^1.4
P2 = 4.7 atm</p>
<p>Using the ideal gas law again, we can find the final temperature:</p>
<p>P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2
1 atm <em> 1 L / 293 K = 4.7 atm </em> 1/3 L / T2
T2 = 463 K</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> A refrigerator operates on a Carnot cycle. The refrigerator maintains a temperature of 5°C in the cold reservoir and rejects heat to a room at 30°C. How much work is required to remove 1 kJ of heat from the cold reservoir?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The work required to remove heat from the cold reservoir is given by:</p>
<p>W = Qc(Tc/Th - 1)
W = 1 kJ * (278 K / 303 K - 1)
W = 0.25 kJ</p>
