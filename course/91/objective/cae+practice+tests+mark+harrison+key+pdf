<p><b>How do I study for the CAE exam?</b> </p>
<p><b>What is the passing grade for the CAE exam?</b> Valid scores on the CAE Exam range from 160 to 210. A score of 180 or above is considered a “pass” and students with that score will receive the Cambridge C1 Advanced certificate, which corresponds to a level C1 in English on the CEFR.</p>
<p><b>What is the score in CAE?</b> The highest attainable Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE) exam score is 210. Candidates who secure scores ranging from 193 to 199 will be awarded a grade B. Similarly, those who achieve scores from 180 to 192 will earn a grade C.</p>
<p><b>Does Harvard accept CAE?</b> Hundreds of universities and colleges across the USA accept C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency for admission; including top institutions such as Harvard University, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Dartmouth College, Wellesley College and The Juilliard School.</p>
<p><b>Is CAE C1 hard?</b> The Cambridge Advanced Certificate (CAE) exam is a challenging test of English proficiency, and some parts are notoriously difficult.</p>
<p><b>Is CAE higher than IELTS?</b> A pass grade in CAE would be the equivalent of about 7.0 in IELTS. IELTS isn't easier - just different. Getting into a British university with an IELTS or CAE certificate is going to need the same high level of English. CAE is less academic than IELTS - the topics are broader, the writing tasks more varied.</p>
<p><b>Can you pass CAE with B2?</b> If your performance is below Level C1, but falls within Level B2 (scale score 160–179), we will recognise your achievement with a Cambridge English certificate stating that you demonstrated ability at Level B2.</p>
<p><b>How to get C2 in CAE?</b> If you achieve a scale score of 200–230 (grade A, B or C) in your exam, you will receive the Certificate of Proficiency in English at Level C2. We believe it is important to recognise your achievement, even if you do not reach Level C2.</p>
<p><b>How long does it take to prepare for CAE?</b> How to Prepare: 4-6 Weeks Prior to Test. If you are studying for the CAE, it's likely that you already have a basic command of English. Now is the time to study and be able to demonstrate your ability to master the subtleties of the language that will be tested.</p>
