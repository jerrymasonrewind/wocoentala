<p><b>What are the acceptance criteria for forging?</b> All forgings are to be free of cracks, crack-like indications, laps, seams, folds or other injurious indications. At the request of the Surveyor, additional magnetic particle, liquid penetrant and ultrasonic testing may be required for a more detailed evaluation of surface irregularities.</p>
<p><b>What is the ASTM standard for ultrasonic testing of plates?</b> ASTM A 435 gives detailed information regarding the straight beam ultrasonic examination of steel plates.</p>
<p><b>What is UT in NDT?</b> Ultrasonic Testing is a volumetric Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) method. Unlike surface inspection methods, UT makes it possible to find flaws inside the material. High-frequency sound waves are sent into the material with an ultrasonic transducer.</p>
<p><b>What are the most requirements of forging?</b> Heat Resistance and Thermal Stability The forging process involves subjecting the metal to elevated temperatures that exceed its critical temperature. Selecting steel that can withstand these high temperatures without significant degradation, such as softening or deformation, is vital.</p>
<p><b>What is the critical temperature for forging?</b> </p>
<p><b>What are the acceptance criteria for ultrasonic testing?</b> The ultrasonic equipment shall be pulse-echo type 'A' scan suitable for use with transducers oscillating at frequencies between 1&6 MHz. The equipment shall have a valid calibration certificate. The test equipment shall have a calibrated gain control adjustable in discrete 1 or 2 Db steps over a range of at least 60Db.</p>
<p><b>What ASME section is ultrasonic testing?</b> A: The ASME V standard, also known as ASME Section V, provides guidelines for Non-destructive Examination methods, including ultrasonic testing. It covers techniques for detecting and characterizing flaws in materials without causing damage.</p>
<p><b>What is the ASTM code for plates?</b> </p>
<p><b>What is Snell's law in ultrasonic testing?</b> Snell's Law describes the relationship between the incident and refracted angles of a wave as it moves from one material into another material which has a different wave velocity. Refraction takes place at the interface due to the different velocities of the acoustic waves within the two materials.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between ultrasonic and UT testing?</b> Ultrasonic testing is used in a wide range of industries due to its suitability for many different materials. UT is ideally used for inspection of dense, crystalline structures such as metals.</p>
<p><b>How do you calculate UT?</b> UNIVERSAL TIME (UT) This is the same as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) which starts at midnight in Greenwich, England. To find the UT equivalent of a specific time, simply add to it, or subtract from it, as the case may be, the zone difference for your observing location.</p>
<p><b>What is the criteria for acceptance?</b> Acceptance criteria are defined as the conditions that must be satisfied for a product, user story, or increment of work to be accepted.</p>
<p><b>What are the factors to be considered for forging design?</b> Factors such as corrosion resistance, susceptibility to oxidation, and reactivity with other materials at elevated temperatures must be considered. Forgeability: Forgeability refers to the ease with which a material can be forged without cracking or developing defects.</p>
<p><b>What are the acceptance criteria for shaft?</b> Shaft acceptance criteria can be based upon thermal measurements and subsequent analysis of the data to determine the average shaft radius, local concrete cover, and cage alignment.</p>
<p><b>What are the principles of forging?</b> Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of a metal through hammering, pressing, or rolling. These compressive forces are delivered with a hammer or die. Forging is often categorized according to the temperature at which it is performedâ€”cold, warm, or hot forging.</p>
