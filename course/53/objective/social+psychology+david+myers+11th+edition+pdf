<p><strong>Question 1: What is the definition of social psychology and what are its core concepts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Social psychology examines the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals in social situations. It investigates how individuals influence, interact with, and are influenced by others. Core concepts include attitudes, social influence, prejudice, and social perception.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: Discuss the concept of the fundamental attribution error.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to overestimate the influence of internal factors (e.g., personality traits) and underestimate the influence of external factors (e.g., situational constraints) when explaining the behavior of others. This leads us to attribute behavior to stable, personal characteristics rather than situational influences.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: How does social cognition shape our understanding of others?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Social cognition refers to the mental processes involved in understanding others. These include schemas (mental frameworks that help us organize and interpret information), stereotypes (overgeneralized beliefs about groups), and the self-serving bias (the tendency to attribute positive outcomes to our own actions and negative outcomes to external factors).</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: Explain the role of social influence in shaping behavior.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Social influence refers to the ways in which others affect our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Conformity (adjusting our behavior to match the group) and obedience (following orders from a perceived authority figure) are two key forms of social influence. The presence of others, group size, and the characteristics of the influence source can all influence its effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: How can prejudice and discrimination impact individuals and society?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Prejudice is a negative attitude towards a person or group based on their perceived membership in a particular category. Discrimination is the unfair treatment of individuals based on their group membership. Both prejudice and discrimination can have profound negative consequences for individuals and society, leading to psychological distress, social inequality, and even violence.</p>
