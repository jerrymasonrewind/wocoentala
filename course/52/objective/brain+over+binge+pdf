<p><b>What is the brain over binge theory?</b> Once you binge eat many times, your body and brain become conditioned to expect and demand the binges, so your brain automatically sends out strong urges, as if binge eating is necessary for your survival.</p>
<p><b>What happens to your brain when you binge?</b> Your brain craves more and more, and as long as you continue to binge, your brain produces dopamine. No wonder 73% of people surveyed by Netflix reported they have positive feelings when they binge watch.</p>
<p><b>Is binge-watching bad for memory?</b> “Researchers have found that moderate to high television viewing during midlife is associated with increased memory loss and decreased fine motor skills,” explains Manisha Parulekar, M.D., director, division of Geriatrics, and co-director, Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center.</p>
<p><b>What is the psychology of binge-watching?</b> When we watch an exciting show, our brains release dopamine, the "feel-good" neurotransmitter [1]. It's the same chemical that surges when we achieve something rewarding. Binge-watching triggers a constant dopamine release, making it hard to stop.</p>
<p><b>What is the neuroscience behind binge-watching?</b> The line between enjoyment and unhealthy habits Over time, though, our brains produce less dopamine from the same level of activity as we build up a level of tolerance. It takes more and more of the same activity to give us that same feeling of enjoyment, making binge-watching TV shows that much harder to stop.</p>
<p><b>What is the truth about binge-watching?</b> Bingeing All the Time The problem arises when we binge all the time. A 2017 study found that people who binge regularly are more likely to be chronically tired because they stay up later. They are also more sedentary. Numerous studies have shown that sitting for long periods of time isn't good for our physical health.</p>

<p><b>What is the brain's role in overeating?</b> The brain's reward system releases dopamine when tasting food. Researchers at Max Planck discovered a second dopamine release in the stomach, affecting higher cognitive functions. The more we desire a food, the weaker the second release, which might lead to overeating.</p>
<p><b>What is the root cause of binge-watching?</b> People who binge-watch regularly usually use it as an escape from reality and to take away from loneliness or boredom. Another study found correlations between binge-watching and procrastinating.</p>
<p><b>What is the phenomenon of binge-watching?</b> Binge-watching is commonly viewed in parallel with media content addiction, mostly in the case of televised content. For example, when people spent ever more time watching multiple episodes continuously, such as five episodes in a single viewing, this might lead to a greater content addiction in the long run.</p>
