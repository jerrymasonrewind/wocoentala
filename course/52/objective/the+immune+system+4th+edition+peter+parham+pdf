<p><strong>The Immune System: 4th Edition by Peter Parham</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A on Key Concepts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the main function of the immune system?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> The immune system protects the body from infection, injury, and disease by recognizing and eliminating foreign substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How does the immune system distinguish between self and non-self?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> The immune system uses MHC molecules to distinguish between its own cells and foreign cells. MHC molecules present fragments of proteins on the surface of cells, allowing the immune cells to recognize and attack cells with foreign proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the role of antibodies in the immune response?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Antibodies are proteins produced by B cells that specifically bind to and neutralize foreign antigens. They help to prevent infection by targeting and marking pathogens for destruction by other immune cells.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How does the immune system adapt to new pathogens?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> The immune system undergoes a process called clonal selection, where new B and T cells are constantly being created and tested against antigens. When a cell recognizes a specific antigen, it clones itself to create an army of cells that can neutralize the pathogen.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What are some common disorders of the immune system?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Immunodeficiencies occur when the immune system is compromised and cannot effectively protect the body from infection.</p>
