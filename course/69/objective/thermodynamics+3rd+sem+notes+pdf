<p><strong>Question 1: What is the first law of thermodynamics?</strong>
Answer: The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. In other words, the total energy of an isolated system remains constant.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What is entropy?</strong>
Answer: Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases over time.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: What is a reversible process?</strong>
Answer: A reversible process is a process that can be reversed without any change in entropy. In other words, a reversible process is a process that can be carried out in both directions with the same net change in entropy.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: What is the Carnot cycle?</strong>
Answer: The Carnot cycle is an ideal thermodynamic cycle that consists of four reversible processes. The Carnot cycle is the most efficient possible cycle for converting heat into work.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: What is the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics?</strong>
Answer: The Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics states that heat cannot flow spontaneously from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir without external intervention. In other words, the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the spontaneous creation of heat imbalances.</p>
