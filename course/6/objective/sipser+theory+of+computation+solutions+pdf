<p><strong>3. Example Question and Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Prove that the language L = {a^nb^n | n ≥ 1} over the alphabet {a, b} is not regular.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We can assume a regular expression for L is a DFA with n states. Any string in L must be of the form a^nb^n, where n ≥ 1. When the DFA reads the first a, it must transition to state q1. However, there are only n states, and we need at least n + 1 transitions to process the n a's. Therefore, no DFA can accept L, and thus it is not regular.</p>
