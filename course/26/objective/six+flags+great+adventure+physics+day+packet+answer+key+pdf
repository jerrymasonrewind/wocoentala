<p><strong>Six Flags Great Adventure Physics Day Packet Answer Key</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Six Flags Great Adventure offers an annual Physics Day event where students can engage in hands-on physics experiments throughout the park. This answer key provides solutions to the questions posed in the Physics Day packet, covering concepts such as motion, energy, and force.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1: Motion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How does your height affect the time it takes to ride the "El Toro" roller coaster?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Taller people have a shorter time because their potential energy is greater.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the acceleration of a car going from 0 to 60 mph in 10 seconds?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> 6 mph/s</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2: Energy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> A 100-kg ball falls from a height of 20 meters. What is its potential energy before it falls?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> 1960 J</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4:</strong> Two balls of equal mass collide head-on with equal velocities. How do their kinetic energies compare after the collision?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> They are equal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3: Force</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 5:</strong> A 1000-N car is acted upon by a 200-N force forward and a 100-N force backward. What is the net force on the car?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> 100 N forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 6:</strong> How does the angle of attack of an airfoil affect its lift?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The lift increases with increasing angle of attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 4: Circular Motion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 7:</strong> What is the centripetal force required to keep a 50-kg car moving in a circle of radius 50 meters at a speed of 20 m/s?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> 2000 N</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 8:</strong> How does the tangential velocity of a spinning object compare to its centripetal velocity?<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The tangential velocity is perpendicular to the centripetal velocity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 5: Summary</strong></p>
<p>This answer key provides solutions to the questions in the Six Flags Great Adventure Physics Day packet. By working through these experiments, students can gain a deeper understanding of fundamental physics concepts through hands-on activities and real-world examples.</p>
