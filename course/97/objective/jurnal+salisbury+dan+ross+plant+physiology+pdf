<p><b>Is sand living or non-living?</b> Sand, wood and glass are all non-living things. None of them shows any of the characteristics listed above. Non-living things can be divided into two groups. First, come those which were never part of a living thing, such as stone and gold.</p>
<p><b>What are the three major systems in plants?</b> Seeded plants have three organs: roots, stems, and leaves, and three tissue types: ground tissue, vascular tissue, and dermal tissue.</p>
<p><b>Who is the father of plant physiology?</b> Stephan Hales is known as the father of plant physiology. He was an English priest who played a crucial role in scientific fields which include botany, pneumatic chemistry and physiology. He was born on 17 September 1677 in Bekesbourne, Kent, England.</p>
<p><b>Who is the father of botany?</b> Theophrastus, a Greek naturalist is known as the Father of Botany, the Father of Zoology, and the Father of Embryology. Botany deals with the study of plants and their characteristics.</p>
<p><b>What is a plant physiology major?</b> Plant physiology is the study of plant processes, including chemical, physical and biological functions. As a plant physiologist, you study living plants, particularly at the molecular, cellular and genetic levels. Understanding gene function is a common objective in this field.</p>
<p><b>What are physiology processes?</b> A physiological process such as photosynthesis, respiration, or transpiration actually is an aggregation of chemical and physical processes. To understand the mechanism of a physiological process, it is necessary to resolve it into its physical and chemical components.</p>
<p><b>What are the process plant processes?</b> Plants make food by a process called photosynthesis. In this process, carbon dioxide and water in the presence of chlorophyll (the green pigment) and light energy are changed into glucose (a sugar). This energy-rich sugar is the source of food used by most plants. Photosynthesis is special to plants!</p>
<p><b>What are the different plant processes?</b> Plant growth and development relies on water for transpiration, photosynthesis, and respiration. The unique ability of water to regulate temperatures, dissolve molecules of life, and allow gas exchange, is essential for all life on earth.</p>
<p><b>What are the 6 basic life processes anatomy and physiology?</b> The basic processes of life include organization, metabolism, responsiveness, movements, and reproduction. In humans, who represent the most complex form of life, there are additional requirements such as growth, differentiation, respiration, digestion, and excretion. All of these processes are interrelated.</p>

<p><b>What two processes do plants go through?</b> Photosynthesis – The process of using chlorophyll to capture light energy and convert it to energy stored in sugars. Photosynthesis uses light energy, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) to generate glucose with a byproduct of oxygen. Transpiration – The loss of water vapor through the stomates of leaves.</p>
