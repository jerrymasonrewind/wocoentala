<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>
What is the first law of thermodynamics and how is it mathematically expressed?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted. Mathematically, it is expressed as:</p>
<pre><code>dQ = dU + dW</code></pre>
<p>where dQ is the heat added to the system, dU is the change in internal energy, and dW is the work done by the system.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
Explain the concept of entropy in thermodynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. It is defined as the ratio of the heat change to the temperature at which the change occurs. A system with higher entropy is more disordered and has less potential for useful work.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong>
What is the significance of the Carnot cycle in thermodynamics?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
The Carnot cycle is a theoretical cycle that represents the most efficient way to convert heat into work. It consists of four processes: two isothermal processes and two adiabatic processes. The efficiency of the Carnot cycle is given by:</p>
<pre><code>η = 1 - T_C / T_H</code></pre>
<p>where T_C is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_H is the temperature of the hot reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong>
Explain the relationship between heat capacity and specific heat.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance by one unit. Specific heat is the heat capacity per unit mass of a substance. The relationship between the two is:</p>
<pre><code>Q = mcΔT</code></pre>
<p>where Q is the heat added to the substance, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.</p>
