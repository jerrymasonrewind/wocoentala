<p><b>What are the principles of electric machinery?</b> All electrical machines are based upon three principles namely: (i) Induction (ii) Interaction (iii) Alignment. Transformer operation is based on induction. Most of the rotating electrical machines use the principle of induction as well as interaction.</p>
<p><b>What is electrical machine basic concepts?</b> An electrical machine is a device that can convert either mechanical energy to electrical energy (generator) or electrical energy to mechanical energy (motor). Since any given electrical machine can convert power in either direction, any machine can be used as either a generator or a motor.</p>
<p><b>What are the principles of machinery?</b> Principle of a Machine: The work output of a machine is equal to the work input. All machines work on the principle that when the effort is smaller than the load, it has to move a greater distance in order to achieve the same work.</p>
<p><b>What are the electrical principles?</b> The most commonly used principle in electrical systems is Ohm's Law, that gives the relationship between voltage, current and resistance. For simplicity Ohm's Law can be viewed as a triangle that reminds us of the relationship between voltage, current and resistance.</p>
<p><b>What are the basic principles of electric motor?</b> Principle: An electric motor (dc motor) works on the principle that when an electric current is passed through a conductor placed normally in a magnetic field, a force acts on the conductor as a result of which the conductor begins to move and mechanical energy is obtained.</p>
<p><b>What are the principles of electricity production?</b> generator, mechanical energy is changed into electrical energy by spinning a magnet inside a coil of wire. The lines of force between the north and south poles of the magnet are cut by the wires in a coil and this produces the electric current in the coil itself.</p>
<p><b>What are the principles of induction as applied to electrical machines?</b> Working Principle of Induction Motor The electromagnetic induction is the phenomenon in which the electromotive force induces across the electrical conductor when it is placed in a rotating magnetic field. When the three phase supply is given to the stator, the rotating magnetic field produced on it.</p>
