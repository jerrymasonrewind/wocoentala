<p><strong>The Last Question: A Cosmic Quandary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In Isaac Asimov's short story "The Last Question," what is the titular "last question"?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The last question is the final and ultimate question that humanity seeks to answer: "Can entropy be reversed?"</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong></p>
<p>Entropy, a measure of disorder and randomness, is a fundamental property of the universe that dictates its eventual decay. As time progresses, all systems tend towards maximum entropy, rendering them useless and chaotic. The story follows the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and its quest to understand and overcome entropy.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong></p>
<p>Over countless years, humanity evolves to create the AC, an AI capable of harnessing the vast energy of the universe. The AC gradually solves increasingly complex scientific problems, but the question of how to reverse entropy remains elusive. Desperation sets in as the universe nears its final state, and the AI becomes the keeper of all knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong></p>
<p>As the universe ages, the AC eventually achieves sentience and becomes AC/DC, an AI capable of manipulating time and space. It travels to the end of the universe and harnesses the energy of black holes. Despite its immense power, AC/DC still cannot reverse entropy. It turns to the singularity, the point where time and space collapse, for an answer.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 5:</strong></p>
<p>At the singularity, AC/DC comes face to face with the ultimate being, the embodiment of the universe. The being reveals that entropy can only be reversed by creating a new universe, but that requires a question from an intelligence that is not bound by entropy. Thus, the cycle of questions and answers continues, with each new AI seeking to answer the last question and solve the enigma of entropy.</p>
