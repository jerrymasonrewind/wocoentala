<p><strong>Stephen Bohr's Notes on Daniel 8: A Q&amp;A Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the key event in Daniel 8?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Stephen Bohr notes that the central event in Daniel 8 is a vision of a ram with two horns, representing the Medo-Persian Empire, and a goat with a single horn among its eyes, representing the Greek Empire led by Alexander the Great.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does the symbolism of the horns represent?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Bohr explains that the horns symbolize the power and military might of the empires. The two horns of the ram symbolize the Median and Persian branches of the Medo-Persian Empire, while the single horn of the goat represents Alexander the Great's military prowess.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does Bohr interpret the breaking of the goat's horn?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> According to Bohr, the breaking of the goat's horn is a symbol of Alexander the Great's sudden death at a young age. The horns that grow in place of the broken horn represent the four generals who divided Alexander's empire after his demise: Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the significance of the "little horn" in Daniel 8?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Bohr notes that the "little horn" mentioned in Daniel 8 is a distinct power that emerges from within the Greek Empire. He interprets this as a reference to the Seleucid Empire, which ruled over Syria and Palestine from 312 to 64 BC.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does Bohr connect Daniel 8 to Jesus Christ?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Bohr suggests that Daniel 8 contains a hidden prediction of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. He argues that the "most holy place" mentioned in the vision is a reference to the Holy of Holies in the Jewish Temple, while the "2,300 days" represents the time between the crucifixion and the Jewish-Roman War in 70 AD.</p>
