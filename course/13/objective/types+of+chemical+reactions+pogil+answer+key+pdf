<p><strong>Types of Chemical Reactions POGIL Answer Key PDF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What are the five basic types of chemical reactions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synthesis (Combination):</strong> Two substances combine to form one product.</li>
<li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> One substance breaks down into two or more products.</li>
<li><strong>Single-Replacement (Displacement):</strong> One element replaces another element in a compound.</li>
<li><strong>Double-Replacement (Metathesis):</strong> Two compounds exchange positive and negative ions to form two new compounds.</li>
<li><strong>Combustion:</strong> A substance reacts with oxygen to release heat and light.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2: Identify the type of reaction for the following equation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Equation:</strong> 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Single-Replacement</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: What is the difference between an exothermic and endothermic reaction?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exothermic:</strong> Releases energy as heat or light (indicated by a negative ΔH).</li>
<li><strong>Endothermic:</strong> Absorbs energy from the surroundings (indicated by a positive ΔH).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4: What is the role of catalysts in chemical reactions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Catalysts are substances that speed up the rate of a reaction without being consumed. They provide an alternative pathway for the reaction, lowering the activation energy required.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: Predict the products for the following reaction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Equation:</strong> CuO + 2HCl →</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> CuCl2 + H2O</p>
<p>This is a <strong>single-replacement</strong> reaction, where chlorine displaces oxygen in copper oxide to form copper chloride and water.</p>
