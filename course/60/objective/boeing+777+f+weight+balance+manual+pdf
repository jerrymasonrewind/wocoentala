<p><b>What is the difference between 777F and 777-200LR?</b> The -200LR features an increased MTOW and the same wing as the 777-300ER. The 777F is a cargo version of this variant. Three optional auxiliary fuel tanks take the baseline fuel tank capacity from 181,289 l to 203,570 l.</p>
<p><b>What are the FAA requirements for weight and balance?</b> 14 CFR part 125 requires aircraft with 20 or more seats or maximum payload capacity of 6,000 pounds or more to be weighed every 36 calendar months. Multi-engine aircraft operated under 14 CFR part 135 are also required to be weighed every 36 months.</p>
<p><b>What is the cargo capacity of the 777-200LR?</b> The Boeing 777-200LR is capable of carrying approximately 15,000kgs of cargo in addition to a full passenger load. The Boeing 777F is the most environmentally-friendly freighter operated today, with the lowest fuel burn of any comparably-sized cargo aircraft.</p>
<p><b>How many compartments are there in the fwd hold of a B777 300ER?</b> </p>
<p><b>What is the difference between 777D and 777F?</b> The 777D's two-piece pistons come with a deep bowl, low volume crevice design to enhance combustion and fuel efficiency while lowering emissions. Although, the 777F's corrosion-resistant, stainless steel top ring reduces ring, groove and liner wear, providing a longer life for the truck.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between 777-200LR and 777-300ER?</b> 777ER gives 13,084 kilometer range and another model is 777-200LR is actually long range with 15,844 kilometers flying capacity. 777-300 ER has just extra 575 kms range comparing 777-200 ER. ( total is 13,650 kms).</p>
<p><b>What is the formula for weight and balance?</b> How do you calculate balance weight? To calculate the balance or the center of gravity, one uses the formula: CG = Σ (weight × arm) / Σ weight. Here, each item's weight is multiplied by its distance (arm) from a reference point, producing a moment.</p>
<p><b>What are the rules for weighing balance?</b> 2) Never weigh chemicals directly in contact with the balance pan; use vessels, weighing paper or filter paper. 3) Do not weigh hot or cold objects on the balance. Hot objects will give erroneously lower readings due to air buoyancy, while cold objects will give higher readings due to the condensation of water vapor.</p>
<p><b>What is a weight balance manual?</b> What is the Weight and Balance Manual? The weight and balance manual is part of the aircraft operating documentation. No different to flight operations manuals and maintenance manuals, the WBM provides detailed and specific instructions to the operator of the aircraft on how it must be loaded in order to be safe.</p>
<p><b>What is the maximum cargo weight of 777F?</b> </p>
<p><b>How much weight can a 777 carry?</b> Boeing 777 freighter, with total loadable weight capacity of 100 tons, can accommodate maximum 21.6 tons heavy cargo by using “Heavy Duty Pallet”.</p>
<p><b>What is the volume of the 777F?</b> (542 m3) on the main deck, and 18 each LD-3 containers, and 14 LD-3 containers (Total of 32) on the forward and aft lower deck compartments. For a total aircraft volume of 24,843 cu ft. (703 m3).</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between 777-300ER and 777-300?</b> The 777-300 and the 777-300ER are the largest Boeing 777 variants, differing in range and seating capacity. The 777-300 has a shorter range (11,165 km) but more seats (up to 550), while the 777-300ER can fly further (13,650 km) with seats up to 396.</p>
<p><b>What is the maximum takeoff weight of 777-300ER?</b> The enhanced airplane's maximum takeoff weight is 775,000 pounds, or 351,534 kilograms. Its design range is 7,880 nautical miles.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between B777 9x and B777 300ER?</b> The 777-9 is stretched by three extra seat rows and flies 250 nmi (460 km; 290 mi) farther than the 777-300ER with the same weight. It is 9.4 ft (2.9 m) longer than the -300ER for a 251 ft 9 in (76.7 m) length. It will seat typically 426 passengers over a range of 7,285 nmi (13,500 km; 8,383 mi).</p>
<p><b>How much does a 777F weigh?</b> </p>
<p><b>What does LR stand for in 777?</b> The VIP configuration of the 777-200LR variant (LR stands for Long Range), which became available in 2006, can hold 52,721 usable gallons and burns 5.5 gallons per nautical mile. When it is fully juiced, fuel accounts for almost half its 766,000 pounds of maximum takeoff weight.</p>
<p><b>Who is the largest operator of 777F?</b> Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet with 148 aircraft.</p>
<p><b>Why does the 777-300ER have no winglets?</b> Because winglets are a tradeoff: In the highly visible case of the 777, an airplane with exceptionally long range, the wings grew so long that folding wingtips were offered to get into tight airport gates.</p>
<p><b>How to tell the difference between 777-200 and 777-300?</b> Boeing 777-300 The 777-300 is significantly longer than the 777-200 (about 10 m), so it is easy to keep them apart. Just count the number of doors on each side: the 200 has four, the 300 five. Like the original 777-200 is has normal wing tips. This is how to distinguish the 777-300 from the -300ER.</p>
<p><b>What does er stand for in Boeing 777?</b> Boeing 777-200ER – The major difference between the Boeing 777-200 and the 777-200ER (ER stands for 'extended range') is that the 777-200ER has a longer range with a higher maximum takeoff weight.</p>
<p><b>What is the meaning of 777-200LR?</b> The 777-200LR Worldliner and the 777-300ER (Extended Range) are two long-range airplanes that Boeing developed to offer airlines additional flexibility in serving the nonstop routes that passengers prefer.</p>
<p><b>Is Boeing 777-200LR comfortable?</b> Each economy seat has 31-32 inches of pitch, which I found to be comfortable on this long-haul flight. Additionally, the seats were 18.5 inches wide, which made for a comfortable flight. I liked that the headrest could be easily formed to fit your head.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between B777 200LR and er?</b> In the case of the 777-200, the initial extended-range variant was called the 777-200ER. Boeing then realized that they could further modify the airframe to make it the longest-range airliner in the world. So they used the suffix “LR” for “Longer Range” to differentiate it from the ER.</p>
<p><b>How old is 777-200LR?</b> The second long-range model, the 777-200LR, rolled out on February 15, 2005, and completed its first flight on March 8, 2005.</p>
