<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>
<p>Solve for the internal energy of a closed system that undergoes an adiabatic process with no work done on or by the system.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a closed system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system:</p>
<pre><code>ΔU = Q - W</code></pre>
<p>For an adiabatic process, Q = 0 and W = 0, so:</p>
<pre><code>ΔU = 0</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, the internal energy of a closed system undergoing an adiabatic process remains constant.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>
<p>A heat engine operates between a hot reservoir at 600 K and a cold reservoir at 300 K. What is the maximum thermal efficiency of this engine?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The maximum thermal efficiency of a heat engine is given by the Carnot efficiency:</p>
<pre><code>η = 1 - TC / TH</code></pre>
<p>where TC is the temperature of the cold reservoir and TH is the temperature of the hot reservoir. Substituting the given values:</p>
<pre><code>η = 1 - 300 K / 600 K = 0.5</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, the maximum thermal efficiency of this engine is 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>
<p>Determine the entropy change of a closed system undergoing an isothermal process with heat transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>For an isothermal process, the temperature of the system remains constant. The entropy change is given by:</p>
<pre><code>ΔS = Q / T</code></pre>
<p>where Q is the heat transferred to the system and T is the temperature. Substituting the given conditions:</p>
<pre><code>ΔS = Q / T</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, the entropy change of a closed system undergoing an isothermal process is directly proportional to the heat transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong></p>
<p>Calculate the work done by a Carnot heat engine operating between a hot reservoir at 1000 K and a cold reservoir at 200 K if the heat transfer from the hot reservoir is 1000 J.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The work done by a Carnot heat engine is given by:</p>
<pre><code>W = Q (1 - TC / TH)</code></pre>
<p>where Q is the heat transfer from the hot reservoir, TC is the temperature of the cold reservoir, and TH is the temperature of the hot reservoir. Substituting the given values:</p>
<pre><code>W = 1000 J (1 - 200 K / 1000 K) = 800 J</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, the work done by the engine is 800 J.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong></p>
<p>What is the Gibbs free energy of a closed system at equilibrium?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The Gibbs free energy of a closed system at equilibrium is minimized and is given by:</p>
<pre><code>G = H - TS</code></pre>
<p>where H is the enthalpy, T is the temperature, and S is the entropy. At equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy is at its lowest value.</p>
