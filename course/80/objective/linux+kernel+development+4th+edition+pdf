<p><b>Which programming language is most of the Linux kernel written?</b> Most of the kernel code is written in C as supported by the GNU compiler collection (GCC) which has extensions beyond standard C. The code also contains assembly code for architecture-specific logic such as optimizing memory use and task execution.</p>
<p><b>What is the official language for Linux kernel development?</b> The kernel is written in the C programming language [c-language]. More precisely, the kernel is typically compiled with gcc [gcc] under -std=gnu11 [gcc-c-dialect-options]: the GNU dialect of ISO C11. clang [clang] is also supported, see docs on Building Linux with Clang/LLVM.</p>
<p><b>Can I learn Linux on my own?</b> The best way is to learn it in a very “natural” way, as below. Before installing Linux, try to use open source software as much as possible. Get yourself familiar with open-source alternatives. Often the main obstacle to replace Window with Linux is the applications that we are already used to.</p>
<p><b>Why is kernel development considered difficult?</b> Coding in kernel can be challenging, in part because one cannot use common libraries (like a full-featured libc), and because one needs to use a source-level debugger like gdb. Rebooting the computer is often required. This is not just a problem of convenience to the developers.</p>
<p><b>Is Windows kernel better than Linux kernel?</b> The NT (Windows) and Linux kernels are both robust and efficient general-purpose kernels. Their core feature sets are nearly identical, and they're equally good starting points for modern operating systems. However, NT is a newer design than Linux, with better security, I/O, and device driver models.</p>
