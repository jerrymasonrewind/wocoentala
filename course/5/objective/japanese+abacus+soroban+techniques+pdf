<p><b>What is the soroban technique?</b> The practice of soroban includes the teacher reciting a string of numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a song-like manner where at the end, the answer is given by the teacher. This helps train the ability to follow the tempo given by the teacher while remaining calm and accurate.</p>
<p><b>What is the Japanese soroban method of mental calculation?</b> In the soroban method of mental calculation, the right brain memorizes the patterns of answers processed. In this method, answers are stored in the long-term memory as intuitive images. The memorization method (which uses the left brain) that is commonly utilized for examinations only uses the short-term memory.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between soroban and abacus?</b> Unlike the Chinese abacus, the soroban has an added bead called a go-dama, positioned at the center of the abacus. The go-dama is used as a decimal point for more intricate calculations.</p>

<p><b>What is the history of abacus and soroban?</b> The invention of the abacus likely occurred in Sumeria around 2700 to 2300 B.C.E., which used a base 60 system, but the oldest known example of an abacus is the Salamis Tablet from Greece (300 B.C.E). Variations of the abacus include the Japanese soroban, Chinese suanpan, Russian schoty, and the Inca yupana.</p>
<p><b>Can I teach myself abacus?</b> These Abacus or mental arithmetic techniques employed have been designed after spending years in the education field. At home, it's nearly impossible to learn or develop learning techniques. Instructors are committed and professionally trained.</p>
<p><b>What is abacus six finger technique?</b> At UCMAS, kids learn the 6-Finger Technique for mental math. They use the 3 fingers of each hand to move beads on the abacus in specific ways to solve math problems quickly and accurately. This practice not only boosts math skills but also activates parts of the brain linked to numbers, memory, and problem-solving.</p>
