<p><strong>The Moving Body: Teaching Creative Theatre by Jacques Lecoq and Jean Gabriel Cara</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Jacques Lecoq was a renowned French mime and teacher who developed a unique approach to physical theatre known as "The Moving Body." Along with Jean Gabriel Cara, he authored the seminal work "The Moving Body: Teaching Creative Theatre," which has become a fundamental text for aspiring actors.</p>
<p><strong>Q1: What is the core concept of Lecoq's approach?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q2: How is the body used as a creative tool in this method?</strong></p>

<p>A3: Lecoq's approach is grounded in the following principles:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Q4: How does Cara contribute to the methodology?</strong></p>
