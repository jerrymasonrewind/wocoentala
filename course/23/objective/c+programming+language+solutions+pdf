<p><b>What is the basic programming language C?</b> C programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games and is considered a programming foundation in the process of ...</p>
<p><b>What is C language for programmers?</b> C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.</p>

<p><b>How to fix error in C?</b> To clear errors in a C program, carefully review your code for any syntax or logical mistakes, such as missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect variable usage. Additionally, utilise a compiler or integrated development environment (IDE) that can detect and point out specific errors to be fixed.</p>
<p><b>How to learn C quickly?</b> Understand the type of data that you are working with, such as whether it's an integer or a character. C is based on data types, so understanding this characteristic is the foundation for writing programs that work well. Learn the operators. Operators are symbols that tell the compiler program what to do.</p>
