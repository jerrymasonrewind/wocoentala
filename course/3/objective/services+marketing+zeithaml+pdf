<p><strong>Services Marketing: Questions and Answers from Zeithaml's PDF</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the definition of a service?</strong></p>
<p>According to Zeithaml's PDF, services are activities, benefits, or satisfactions that are essentially intangible and do not result in ownership of any physical product. They are often consumed at the same time they are produced, and their value is dependent on the customer's perception of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>What are the characteristics that differentiate services from products?</strong></p>
<p>Services are typically intangible, heterogeneous (varying in quality), perishable, and inseparable from the provider. This means that customers have difficulty assessing the quality of services before purchasing them, and their experiences can be highly influenced by the actions and attitudes of the service providers.</p>
<p><strong>What are the key elements of service quality?</strong></p>
<p>Zeithaml identifies five key elements of service quality: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. Reliability refers to the consistency and accuracy of service delivery. Responsiveness is the willingness and ability to help customers quickly and efficiently. Assurance is the extent to which customers trust and have confidence in the service provider. Empathy involves understanding and meeting customers' individual needs. Tangibles include the physical environment and appearance of service providers.</p>
