<p><strong>Traffic and Highway Engineering 4th Edition Solution Manual PDF: Comprehensive Guide</strong></p>
<p>The 4th edition of "Traffic and Highway Engineering" by Nicholas J. Garber and Lester A. Hoel is a comprehensive textbook that covers the fundamental principles of traffic and highway engineering. The accompanying solution manual provides detailed, step-by-step solutions to all end-of-chapter problems, making it an invaluable resource for students and practitioners alike.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: Traffic Engineering Fundamentals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Determine the capacity of a two-lane rural highway with a posted speed limit of 60 mph, a directional distribution factor of 1.0, a peak-hour factor of 0.85, and a capacity per lane of 1,200 vehicles per hour.</li>
<li>A: Capacity = (2 lanes/hr) <em> (1,200 vehicles/lane/hr) </em> (1.0) * (0.85) = 2,040 vehicles/hr</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Traffic Studies and Analyses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Conduct a traffic volume study at an intersection using an automatic traffic recorder. Determine the hourly volume for each approach and the peak-hour volume.</li>
<li>A: Use the following steps:<ul>
<li>Set up the recorder and collect data for a 24-hour period.</li>
<li>Divide the data into hourly intervals and count the number of vehicles for each approach.</li>
<li>Identify the hour with the highest volume as the peak hour.</li>
<li>Calculate the hourly volume for each approach and the peak-hour volume.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Geometric Design of Highways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Design a horizontal curve for a highway with a speed limit of 70 mph and a radius of 1,200 feet.</li>
<li>A: Use the following formula:<ul>
<li>Degree of curvature = (360 degrees) / (2 <em> pi </em> radius) = 0.158 degrees</li>
<li>Length of curve = (2 <em> pi </em> radius) * (degree of curvature) = 942 feet</li>
<li>Tangent length = (70 mph) * (1.47) = 1,029 feet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Highway Capacity and Level of Service</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Determine the level of service (LOS) for a highway section with a volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c) of 0.85.</li>
<li>A: Use the following table:<ul>
<li>v/c range | LOS</li>
<li>0.00 - 0.60 | A</li>
<li>0.60 - 0.75 | B</li>
<li>0.75 - 0.90 | C</li>
<li>0.90 - 1.00 | D</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>1.00 | F</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Therefore, the LOS for this section is C.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Traffic Signal Design and Operation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Design a traffic signal for an intersection with a major and minor approach. The major approach has a peak-hour volume of 1,000 vehicles and the minor approach has a peak-hour volume of 200 vehicles.</li>
<li>A: Use the following steps:<ul>
<li>Calculate the cycle length: (major volume + minor volume) / 2 = 600 seconds</li>
<li>Allocate green time to the major approach: 1,000 / 1,200 * 600 = 500 seconds</li>
<li>Allocate green time to the minor approach: 200 / 1,200 * 600 = 100 seconds</li>
<li>Set the yellow and red times according to standard guidelines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
