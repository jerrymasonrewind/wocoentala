<p><strong>UNE Medical Chemistry Final Exam PDF: A Comprehensive Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The UNE Medical Chemistry final exam is a comprehensive assessment of the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course. This article provides a set of questions and answers extracted from the official UNE Medical Chemistry final exam PDF, covering key concepts in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1: Bioenergetics and Carbohydrates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the concept of Gibbs free energy and its role in biological processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Gibbs free energy (ΔG) measures the spontaneity of a reaction. A negative ΔG indicates a spontaneous reaction, while a positive ΔG indicates a nonspontaneous reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Describe the structure and function of cellulose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose molecules linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. It is found in plant cell walls and provides structural support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2: Proteins and Amino Acids</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Outline the different levels of protein structure and their interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Protein structure includes primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (α-helices and β-sheets), tertiary (three-dimensional folding), and quaternary (multiple polypeptide chains). These structures are stabilized by various interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Describe the role of amino acid side chains in protein function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Amino acid side chains vary in their properties (e.g., charge, polarity, hydrophobicity) and contribute to protein function by interacting with other molecules, forming active sites, and participating in catalytic reactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3: Lipids and Membranes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the structure and properties of phospholipids and their role in biological membranes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules with a polar head group and two fatty acid tails. They form bilayers in biological membranes, providing a semi-permeable barrier that regulates the passage of molecules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Describe the different types of membrane proteins and their functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Membrane proteins include integral proteins (embedded in the membrane) and peripheral proteins (attached to the membrane surface). They perform various functions, such as transport, signaling, cell-cell recognition, and enzymatic reactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 4: Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Outline the structure and function of DNA and RNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> DNA is a double-stranded helix composed of nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine). It carries genetic information. RNA is a single-stranded molecule that participates in transcription, translation, and gene regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the central dogma of molecular biology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The central dogma states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. This process allows genetic information to be transferred from DNA to proteins, which execute biological functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paragraph 5: Medicinal Chemistry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Describe the principles of drug design and optimization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Drug design involves identifying and modifying lead compounds to improve their potency, selectivity, and safety. Optimization techniques include structure-activity relationship studies, molecular modeling, and in vitro/in vivo testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in drug development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pharmacokinetics studies the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a drug. Pharmacodynamics investigates the effects of a drug on the body, targeting specific receptors or biological pathways.</p>
</li>
