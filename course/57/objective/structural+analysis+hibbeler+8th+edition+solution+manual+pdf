<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the difference between a determinate and an indeterminate structure?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A determinate structure has a number of reactions that can be found by using equilibrium equations alone. An indeterminate structure has more reactions than can be found by equilibrium equations alone, and additional equations are required to solve for the reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the purpose of a shear diagram?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A shear diagram shows the shear force in a beam at any given point along its length. It is used to determine the maximum shear force in the beam, which is important for designing the beam to resist shear stresses.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> What is the difference between a bending moment diagram and a shear force diagram?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A bending moment diagram shows the bending moment in a beam at any given point along its length. It is used to determine the maximum bending moment in the beam, which is important for designing the beam to resist bending stresses. A shear force diagram shows the shear force in a beam at any given point along its length. It is used to determine the maximum shear force in the beam, which is important for designing the beam to resist shear stresses.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What is the purpose of a deflection-load curve?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A deflection-load curve shows the deflection of a beam under a given load. It is used to determine the maximum deflection of the beam, which is important for ensuring that the beam will not deflect too much under load.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> What is the difference between a static and a dynamic load?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A static load is a load that does not vary with time. A dynamic load is a load that varies with time. Dynamic loads can be more difficult to design for than static loads because they can cause the beam to vibrate.</p>
