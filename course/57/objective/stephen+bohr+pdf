<p><strong>Stephen Bohr: A Pioneer in Quantum Physics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: Who was Stephen Bohr?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Stephen Bohr was a Danish physicist who made significant contributions to the development of quantum physics in the early 20th century. He is best known for his atomic model, which proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in discrete energy levels.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What is the Bohr atomic model?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Bohr's atomic model postulates that electrons exist in specific energy levels around the nucleus. Each level has a specific energy value, and an electron can only move between levels by absorbing or emitting a photon with the appropriate energy. This model explained the observed spectral lines of atoms and laid the foundation for understanding atomic structure.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: What is the significance of the Bohr model?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Bohr model was a major breakthrough in quantum physics. It introduced the concept of quantized energy levels, which is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics. It also provided a theoretical framework for understanding atomic spectra and the behavior of electrons in atoms.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: What were Bohr's other contributions to quantum physics?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: In addition to the atomic model, Bohr made other important contributions to quantum physics. He developed the correspondence principle, which states that the behavior of particles in classical physics can be recovered from quantum mechanics in the limit of large quantum numbers. He also proposed the concept of complementarity, which suggests that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: Where can I find more information about Stephen Bohr?</strong></p>
