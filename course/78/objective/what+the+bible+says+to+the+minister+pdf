<p><strong>What the Bible Says to the Minister</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What is the biblical calling of a minister?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Ministers are called by God to proclaim the gospel, teach the truth, lead the church, and shepherd the flock entrusted to them. Scripture emphasizes the importance of both preaching and pastoral care: "Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with complete patience and teaching" (2 Timothy 4:2) and "Pay careful attention to yourself and to the teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you" (1 Timothy 4:16).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What qualifications must a minister meet?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Bible provides specific qualifications for ministers, including irreproachable character, spiritual maturity, and doctrinal soundness. They must be "above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money" (1 Timothy 3:2-3). Additionally, they must "hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it" (Titus 1:9).</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: What authority does a minister have?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Ministers have the authority to preach the gospel, administer the sacraments, and lead the church in worship. They are accountable to God for their ministry and are to exercise their authority with humility, love, and faithfulness. While they are not to lord over others, they are responsible for maintaining sound doctrine and guiding the flock towards spiritual maturity: "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you" (Hebrews 13:17).</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: What are the challenges and rewards of ministry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Ministry can be both challenging and rewarding. Ministers encounter joys such as witnessing spiritual growth in others, but they also face trials such as criticism, rejection, and personal sacrifices. Scripture encourages ministers to persevere despite difficulties: "Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain" (1 Corinthians 15:58). The ultimate reward for faithful ministers is the approval of Christ: "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master" (Matthew 25:21).</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: What guidance does the Bible offer for effective ministry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Scripture provides numerous practical guidelines for effective ministry, including prayer, preparation, and a focus on the flock's spiritual growth. Ministers are encouraged to "devote yourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word" (Acts 6:4), to "be diligent in studying" (2 Timothy 2:15), and to "shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you do itâ€”not for shameful gain, but eagerly; not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock" (1 Peter 5:2-3).</p>
